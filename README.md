# HackerRank Whiteboard Challenges

## Self driven challenges (Instructions)

On some sessions we will challenge you to face some *whiteboard* challenges on your own time and at your own pace. 
The goal of these exercises is to help both you and and us to detect your fluency at these type of problems (most of us aren't unless we practice a lot).

For each session we ask that you solve two easy problems as a warm up and then one to two more difficult ones. 
For now the most difficult will be of medium difficulty. This is for two reasons, first, the goal of this exercise is to help you feel more comfortable while facing challenges, not to make you an expert; and second, this way it's easier to detect your strengths and weaknesses so we can orientate you better.

Many companies don't ask problems more comlicated than these, and many others don't care about automated tests like Hacker Rank, they want to hear you think and elaborate about your solutions. We will also practice that face to face.

Below you will find the selected problems:

* Choose two easy ones and try to solve them.
* Choose one or two more difficult ones and try to solve them (even if you didin't solve the easy ones)
* Create a github repository with your solutions or attempts at them (it can be a link to a repl.it, the code itself, a link to your solution on HR. We want it to be on Github so we can add comments to it.
* Ping us with your repository so we can start reviewing it.

It is ok to ask questions about it on the algorithms stream on Zulip.
